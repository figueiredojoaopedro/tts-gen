I really wanted was to run a executable made with electron on my machine.
The interface made with electron js would have a place to drop a audio sample to train the model, a text area to write what I want to be generated and a button to generate the audio that would go to an output on a desired folder. this part of the app could be made on app's folder.

If possible, would be cool to create a select input to get what model we want to generate our audios in the executable program.

Could you create an option to convert multiple audio extensions to .wav, .mp3 or mp4?

I don't know if it's possible to embed the server-side folder and run it locally whenever we use the interface, to avoid wasting money with servers to handle our requests. If it's possible to run everything locally with docker, would be awesome.
